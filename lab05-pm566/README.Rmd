## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
stations <- fread("ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/noaa/isd-history.csv")
stations[, USAF := as.integer(USAF)]
```

```{r}
stations[, USAF   := fifelse(USAF == 999999, NA_integer_, USAF)]
stations[, CTRY   := fifelse(CTRY == "", NA_character_, CTRY)]
stations[, STATE  := fifelse(STATE == "", NA_character_, STATE)]
```

```{r}
stations <- unique(stations[, list(USAF, CTRY, STATE)])

stations <- stations[!is.na(USAF)]

stations[, n := 1:.N, by = .(USAF)]
stations <- stations[n == 1,][, n := NULL]
```


## Merge station& met
```{r merging}
df<-merge(
  x=met,
  y=stations,
  all.x = T,
  all.y = F,
  by.x = "USAFID",
  by.y = "USAF"
)



```

## Question 1: Representative station for the US
### generate a representative of each station. We will use the average (meadian could also be a good way to represent it, but it will depend on the case)
```{r}
station_avg<-
df[,.(
  temp     = mean(temp,na.rm=T),
  wind.sp  = mean(wind.sp,na.rm =T),
  atm.press= mean(atm.press,na.rm= T)
),by=.(USAFID,STATE)]

```

### now we need to identify quantiles per variables
```{r}
medians<-
  station_avg[,.(
  temp_50=quantile(temp,probs=.5,na.rm=T),
  wind.sp_50=quantile(wind.sp, probs=.5,na.rm=T),
  atm.press_50=quantile(atm.press,probs=.5,na.rm=T)
)]
medians
```

### now we can find the stations that are the closest to these values
```{r}
station_avg[,temp_dist:=abs(temp-medians$temp_50)]
median_temp_station<-station_avg[order(temp_dist)][1]
median_temp_station
```
the median temperature 

```{r}
station_avg[,wind.sp_dist:=abs(wind.sp-medians$wind.sp_50)]
median_windsp_station<-station_avg[order(wind.sp_dist)][1]
median_windsp_station
```
the median wind speed


```{r}
station_avg[,atm.press_dist:=abs(atm.press-medians$atm.press_50)]
median_atmpress_station<-station_avg[order(atm.press_dist)][1]
median_atmpress_station
```
the median atm press

The station that is closest to the median temperature is 720458.
The station that is closest to the median wind speed is 720929. 
The station that is closest to the median wind speed is 722238.

## Question 2: Representative station per state
### Just like the previous question, you are asked to identify what is the most representative, the median, station per state. This time, instead of looking at one variable at a time, look at the euclidean distance. If multiple stations show in the median, select the one located at the lowest latitude.

we first need to recover the state variable, by MERGEING :)

```{r}
# we first need to recover the state variable, by MERGEING :)
station_avg2<-
df[,.(
  temp     = mean(temp,na.rm=T),
  wind.sp  = mean(wind.sp,na.rm =T),
  atm.press= mean(atm.press,na.rm= T)
),by=.(USAFID,STATE)]
```


```{r}
# Get the medians by state for temperature, wind speed, and atm press
station_avg2[,temp_50:=quantile(temp,probs=.5,na.rm=T),by=STATE]

station_avg2[,wind.sp_50:=quantile(wind.sp,probs=.5,na.rm=T),by=STATE]

station_avg2[,atm.press_50:=quantile(atm.press,probs=.5,na.rm=T),by=STATE]

```

```{r}
# Calculate Euclidean Distance
station_avg2[, eudist := sqrt(
  (temp - temp_50)^2 + (wind.sp - wind.sp_50)^2)]

```

```{r}
# Lowest euclidean distance by State
station_avg2[ , .SD[which.min(eudist)], by = STATE]
```

The station with the lowest euclidean distance between temperature and wind speed is `r median_atmpress_station$USAFID`.


## Question 3: In the middle?
### For each state, identify what is the station that is closest to the mid-point of the state. Combining these with the stations you identified in the previous question, use leaflet() to visualize all ~100 points in the same figure, applying different colors for those identified in this question.

```{r}
# Calculate midpoint by State
station_avg2[, midpoint := sqrt(
  ((temp - temp_50)^2 + (wind.sp - wind.sp_50)^2) / 2
                              )]
```

```{r}
# Lowest midpoint by State
map <- station_avg2[ , .SD[which.min(midpoint)], by = STATE]
```

```{r}
# Create table to map lat/lon
hashtable <- df %>%
  select(USAFID, lat, lon)
hashtable <- distinct(hashtable, USAFID, .keep_all = TRUE)
```


```{r}
# Merge lat/lon data
# Merge state information
map2 <- merge(x = map, y = hashtable, by.x = 'USAFID', by.y = "USAFID", all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE)
```

```{r}
# Create leaflet map
mp.pal <- colorNumeric(c('darkgreen','goldenrod','brown'), domain=map2$midpoint)
# Leadlet map
tempmap <- leaflet(map2) %>% 
# The looks of the Map
  addProviderTiles('CartoDB.Positron') %>% 
# Some circles
  addCircles(
    lat = ~lat, lng=~lon,
    label = ~paste0(round(temp,2), ' C'), 
    color = ~ mp.pal(midpoint),
    opacity = 1, 
    fillOpacity = 1, 
    radius = 500
    ) %>%
# And a pretty legend
  addLegend('bottomleft', pal=mp.pal, values=map2$midpoint,
          title='Midpoint by State', opacity=1)
tempmap
```



## Question 4: Means of means
### Using the quantile() function, generate a summary table that shows the number of states included, average temperature, wind-speed, and atmospheric pressure by the variable “average temperature level,” which you’ll need to create.

### Start by computing the states’ average temperature. Use that measurement to classify them according to the following criteria:low: temp < 20 Mid: temp >= 20 and temp < 25 High: temp >= 25

```{r}
# create
df[,state_temp :=mean(temp,na.rm=T),by= STATE]
df[,temp_cat   :=fifelse(
  state_temp<20,"low-temp",
  fifelse(state_temp<25,"mid-temp","high_temp"))
  ]
```

### Once you are done with that, you can compute the following:
### Number of entries (records),
### Number of NA entries,
### Number of stations,
### Number of states included, and
### Mean temperature, wind-speed, and atmospheric pressure.
### All by the levels described before.

```{r}
# Summary table
df[, .(
  N_entries = .N,
  N_stations = length(unique(USAFID)),
  N_missing = sum(is.na(.SD)),
  N_states = length(unique(STATE)),
  mean_temperature = mean(temp, na.rm = TRUE),
  mean_windspeed = mean(wind.sp, na.rm = TRUE),
  mean_atmpress = mean(atm.press, na.rm = TRUE)
), by = temp_cat]
```



```{r}
table(met$temp_cat,useNA = "always")
```
